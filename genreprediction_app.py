        <p style="color: white;">The Genre Prediction App is an application that utilizes machine learning algorithms and music analysis techniques 
        to predict the genre of a given song. It analyzes various features of a song, such as tempo, instrumentation, and vocal characteristics. 
        It applies a trained model to classify the song into either Hip Hop or Rock genres. This involves a binary classification task, 
        where the model is trained to predict two different classes. The algorithm employed for this task is the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
        algorithm.</p>
