## Genre Prediction App
A Genre Prediction App is an application that 
uses machine learning algorithms and music analysis
 techniques to predict the genre of a given song.
It analyzes various features of the song, such
 as tempo, rhythm, instrumentation, and vocal
 characteristics, and then applies a trained model
to classify the song into different genres like
 rock e.t.c.. This app can be helpful for music
 enthusiasts, DJs, and music streaming platforms
 to automatically categorize and organize songs
 based on their genre.
